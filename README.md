Hello, world! I'm Vince, a Computer Science senior at Rowan Univeristy, and I *really* love creating websites from start to finish. This includes the design, development, and everything in between. My super power is that I'm a CSS geek. Crazy I know. Currently, I'm learning about design systems, component-driven design, and accessibility!
Have a great day :)
